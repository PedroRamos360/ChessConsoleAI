# ChessConsoleAI
Simple chess AI that gets console input of your move and respond with a random possible move.
It doens't use the regular chess notation, the moves are played by writing the square your pieces is and where it will go, for example: e2-e4.
The bot doesn't understand castling or en passant, and the pawns can only promote to queens.
